gifmaker
========

Simple command line tool that turns all the images in a directory into a gif.

Made with lots of help from https://www.socketloop.com/tutorials/

TODO
====

* Clean up code - A lot!
* Allow user input options for other directories and the delay time between frames
* Allow user to choose gif output name
* Optimse for speed
* If images are different sizes, make the size of the final gif equal to the size of the largest image, and plot everything from the center.
